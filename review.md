# Dataframe Helpers

Your splitdate functions is good so i really have to nit pick. The name, usually we camel case or use underscores to increase readability.

# Auto Date

Also a good conscise function. Great job

# List to columnn

I think the docstrig is mostly fine but consider doinng what i did
      param col_name: *provide arguement description here*
That way each elements explanation is split

# Version

Maybe you can find a way to read the pipfile to get version that's be cool
